# Cubed-3d

cub3D is a project that involves building a simple 3D game using the raycasting technique. The project is inspired by early 90s games like Wolfenstein 3D, where 2D maps are rendered into 3D using a raycasting engine. The goal of the project is to create a minimalistic 3D game with basic player movement, textures, and interaction, while practicing fundamental graphics programming concepts.
